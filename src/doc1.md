This is a test document for reproducing the issue with the katex tilde

This should show M with a tilde above:

$\tilde{M}$

This should show the definition of tilde M:

$\tilde{M} = \begin{pmatrix} \alpha_1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \alpha_2 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \alpha_3 \end{pmatrix}$

We should expect this text to still be shown.

## Test Heading

This text should also be visible.
